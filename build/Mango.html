            Mangoes are sweet, creamy fruits that have a range of possible health benefits. They are highly popular around the world.
            The mango is a tropical stone fruit and member of the drupe family. This is a type of plant food with a fleshy outer section that surrounds a shell, or pit. This pit contains a seed.
            Other members of the drupe family include olives, dates, and coconuts.
            There are many different kinds of mango. They vary in color, shape, flavor, and seed size. Although mango skin can be green, red, yellow, or orange, its inner flesh is mostly golden yellow.
            This feature is part of a collection of articles on the health benefits of popular foods. In this article, we explore the many benefits of mangoes, explain their nutritional breakdown, and provide a few healthy recipe ideas.
            <br>
            A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated in the region between 
            northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two 
            types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that 
            are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion. Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the 
            cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange. Mango is the national fruit of 
            India, Pakistan and the Philippines, while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.

It is cultivated extensively in South Asia, Southeast Asia, East and West Africa, the tropical and subtropical Americas, and the Caribbean. Mangoes are also grown in Andalusia, Spain (mainly in Málaga province), as its coastal subtropical climate is one of the few places in mainland Europe that permits the growth of tropical plants and fruit trees. The Canary Islands are another notable Spanish producer of the fruit. Other minor cultivators include North America (in South Florida and the California Coachella Valley), Hawai'i, and Australia. <br> Many commercial cultivars are grafted on to the cold-hardy rootstock of Gomera-1 mango cultivar, originally from Cuba. Its root system is well adapted to a coastal Mediterranean climate. Many of the 1,000+ mango cultivars are easily cultivated using grafted saplings, ranging from the 'turpentine mango' (named for its strong taste of turpentine) to the Bullock's Heart. Dwarf or semidwarf varieties serve as ornamental plants and can be grown in containers. A wide variety of diseases can afflict mangoes. <br> Mango* production – 2020 An important breakthrough in mango cultivation is the use of potassium nitrate and ethrel to induce flowering in mangoes. The discovery was made by Filipino horticulturist Ramon Barba in 1974 and was developed from the unique traditional method of inducing mango flowering using smoke in the Philippines. It allowed mango plantations to induce regular flowering and fruiting year-round. Previously, mangoes were seasonal, because they only flowered every 16 to 18 months. The method is now used in most mango-producing countries.";

Today, these colorful, sweet fruits are a mainstay of Indian cuisine and are popular throughout the world. Mangos can weigh anywhere from a few ounces to more than five pounds each, depending on the variety. Regardless of the type of mango you buy, these fruits offer some impressive health benefits. While mangos were historically only available at the end of the dry season, today they can be found in grocery stores all year long. <br> The vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in mangos can provide important health benefits. For example, vitamin K helps your blood clot effectively and helps prevent anemia. It also plays an important role in helping strengthen your bones. <br> Mangos are also rich in vitamin C, which is important for forming blood vessels and healthy collagen, as well as helping you heal. <br> In addition, mangos can provide other health benefits like: <br> Lower Risk of Cancer <br> Lower Blood Pressure <br> Reduce Inflammation of the Heart";
